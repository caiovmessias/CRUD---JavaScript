# CRUD-JavaScript

This is the second version of an application solved by the teacher through the video lesson.

After its conclusion, I decided to put into practice the knowledge acquired so far and started this project.

It is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) application made only via Javascript. For data manipulation, a vector was used.
